##About Me

Hello, my name is Alexis! I am originally from Charleston, South Carolina and currently live in Jax, FL where I do virtual sales and customer service for Coach. 

I got my undergraduate degree in Fashion Merchandising & Retailing. While at Johnson & Wales Unviersity-Charlotte, I had the amazing oppurtunity to study abroad in Europe twice. While in my Freshman year I focused on Business Ethics and Cross-Cultural Communication in Berlin, Germany. Then, during my senior year I focused on Fashion Entreprenuership and Trend Forecasting in London, England.

 Fun Facts:
 My interests include photography, travel, style, and technology!
 
 I have a 1 1/2 year old little Cavapoo named Sisi who is my first pet and have had her since she was 4 months old. 

 Currently, I am participating in a User Experience Design Bootcamp!

##Past Coding Experience

I took a short course with Codeacademy in HTML and CSS where I did various activities, but I am by no means an expert. I understand the basics, but am eager to gain more practice in these languages. 

##Career Goals

Since graduating 2020 I have found an interest in ECommerce and will be pivoting my career goals away from Fashion Buying to UX Design and Front End Web Development. I think that both of these roles tie in together and the skills would be transferrable. As my future first job in the tech industry, I will be seeking UX Researcher/Designer roles and as I gain more coding experience I see myself as a Front End Web Developer.
